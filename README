This project contains a walkthrough of mirroring the entire Android Open
Source Project (AOSP) and hosting it on a private server. The resulting 
server can be used as the 'master' repository for a group working on 
modifying Android to a common goal, with each member of the group being
able to use the standard 'repo' and 'git' commands to interact with
the server.
