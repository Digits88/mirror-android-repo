We want to do all of this as the user 'git' so that 'git' will own
the repository files

Setup the folder structure. Commands used will result in all git
repositories needing to be placed somewhere inside the 
/home/git/repositories folder. We create an android folder that will
be used to hold all of the android-specific git repositories
	$ cd ~git
	$ sudo -H -u git mkdir repositories
	$ cd repositories
	$ sudo -H -u git mkdir android
	$ cd android

Make the git-daemon script executable, add it to the list of startup items, 
and start it
	$ sudo chmod a+x /etc/init.d/git-daemon
	$ sudo update-rc.d git-daemon defaults
	$ sudo service git-daemon start

Ensure that the service is started
	$ service git-daemon status
 	 * Testing the git daemon: 
 	 * Running
	$ sudo netstat -an | grep 9418
	 tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:9418            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
	 tcp6       0      0 :::9418                 :::*                    LISTEN     

If there were no problems up to here, then the git-daemon is listening on the server. I didn't 
have any problems with firewalls blocking access to that, so perhaps someone with experience 
ensuring that firewalls are not an issue can add to the guide here. 

Setup repo 
Note: This assumes that repo is installed and in your path
Note: If you server is not already plugged into a hardwire, that would be a good idea before 
      you run repo sync. That command will download a few Gb of data. 
	$ sudo -H -u git repo init --mirror -u git://android.git.kernel.org/platform/manifest.git
	$ sudo -H -u git repo sync

Modify the Android manifest
When users create clones of the code from your server, your server address should be used as 
the remote URL in git. The remote URL value is pulled from the manifest.git used to initialize
the Android repo (via the repo command) on their local machine, so we need to modify the 
manifest.git and change the default URL from korg to our server address
Note: This all needs to be run from the client computer
	$ git clone git@yourserver.com:android/platform/manifest.git
	$ cd manifest
	$ git checkout -b local

Open the default.xml file, add your server as a 'remote', and set it as the default remote
e.g. 
	  <remote  name="korg"
		   fetch="git://android.git.kernel.org/"
		   review="review.source.android.com" />
	  <remote  name="myserver"
		   fetch="git@myserver.com:android/" />
	  <default revision="master"
		   remote="myserver" />

Note that the fetch url is not just git@myserver, we have added the ':android/' so that 
the name of each project, after being appended to the remote url, will read similarly to
'git@myserver.com:android/platform/bionic', which is the proper URL for our server 
configuration (where all of the android-specific git's are stored under the android folder). 

Save the file and commit the change
	$ git commit -a -m "Using local mirror"
	$ git push origin local

(Optional) Delete your clone of manifest.git
