Copy your public key to some location, naming it <somename>.pub
If you have an account on the server for your user, then you likely already
have your public key available in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys or ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. 
Otherwise, you'll have to copy it over using something like scp
	$ cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /tmp/hamiltont.pub

Download gitolite, inital configuration
	$ cd ~
	$ git clone git://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite
	$ cd gitolite
	$ sudo src/gl-system-install

Switch to the git user to finish the configuration
Note: You will need the password for the 'git' user, or you will need to reset
it with 'passwd'
	$ su - git
	$ gl-setup /tmp/hamiltont.pub (replace with your .pub file)

That's it for now - once we configure repo we will revisit Gitolite to add
the Android projects
